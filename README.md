> 0. Add site template surround and sidebar - purpose, scope, etc
> 0. ~~try...except in app.py functions~~
> 0. if JSON TO HTML is 0 and AFTER is not populated, stop. if it is, try second attempt. 4 may be excessive

> 4. ~~data regex sanitization of subreddit text field azAZ0-9 and + symbol, underscore etc~~
> 5. ~~[a-zA-Z0-9]+|[\+\_\-]~~
> 6. ~~do not load first page, first time with any results - force-ish toward using Human? checkbox~~
> 7. ~~Count image/videos retrieved for display - ensure AT LEAST (limit), over is better than under~~
> 1. ~~first POST leaves subreddit field blank. subsequent after links, returns default value to subreddit field~~
> 2. ~~An unexpected error occurred in REDDITMEDIA during action [ JSONtoHTML ]: cannot access local variable 'strHtmlThreadEmbed' where it is not associated with a value~~
> 9. add date / days ago to media entry display
> 10. name or acronym - reddit media reveal redmedrev ?
> 11. search subreddit list and category 
> 13. include "BACK" or "BEFORE" link (opposite of "NEXT" or "AFTER" link)
> 14. option to hide header lines (image/video only)
