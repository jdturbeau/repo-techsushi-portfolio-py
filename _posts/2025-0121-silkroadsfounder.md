Ross Ulbricht, Dread Pirate Roberts, founder of Silk Roads, was serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2015. He was pardoned near the end of January 2025.

The rumor mill says a Bitcoin wallet that had been idle since Ulbricht's conviction has become active again. I see articles mentioning $47 million, but had heard rumors of a $600m account.
