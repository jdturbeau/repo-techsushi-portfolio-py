Something about the Signal "leak" sounded very familiar. Not the human error, not the "Shadow IT"...

Five years ago (wow), COVID helped Zoom gain popularity as everyone scrambled to work remotely. The threat of Zoom-bombing, when an uninvited person connects to a meeting, was not far behind. Someone may have shared a link externally or a script could be written to iterate through valid meeting links, as the URL format was the same. I would equate this to high school lab hijinks - typically harmless, disruptive, sometimes entertaining, something discovered while bored. That does not diminish the risk though. The resolution was adding functionality and changing defaults - require a pin/passcode to join, using a waiting room to approve attendees - defense in depth, if one layers fails, another layer mitigates or slows the threat.

Signal and WhatsApp have similar invite functionality - Join via Link or QR Code - and similar default settings.

I draw a parallel to the bystander effect, or diffusion of responsibility. The debate is who owns this issue - the users, the app creator, infosec, leadership? Lots of layers, lots of opportunity, but there is an excuse at each one - the app advertises end to end encryption, the app needs to be convenient, a policy was written to only use SCIFs or approved apps, I thought infosec had written and training everyone on the policy and had been monitoring usage.

It used to take decades or centuries for history to repeat itself before the industrial revolution. In the age of computers, we've narrowed that down to within five years.

tl;dr - Signal "leak" ~ Zoom-bombing
